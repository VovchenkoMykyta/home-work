                The rich text element allows you to create and format headings,
                paragraphs, block-quotes, images, and video all in one place
                instead of having to add and format them individually. Just
                double-click and easily create content.

              <p>
                For dynamic content, add a rich text field to any collection and
                then connect a rich text element to that field in the settings
                panel. Headings, paragraphs, block-quotes, figures, images, and
                figure captions can all be styled.
